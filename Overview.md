## Application Overview

**Purpose**:  
BlueCollar.ai is a mobile platform that connects blue-collar workers (e.g., plumbers, electricians, carpenters) with clients seeking their services. It operates as a marketplace, similar to Uber but tailored for skilled trades, enabling clients to post jobs, workers to browse or be matched with opportunities, and both parties to communicate, manage jobs, and provide feedback.

**Key Features**:  
- **Role-Based Onboarding**: Users select whether they are a worker or client upon signup, tailoring their app experience.
- **Worker Profiles**: Workers create detailed profiles showcasing skills, hourly/daily rates, service areas, and photos of themselves or their work.
- **Job Posting**: Clients post jobs with specifics such as title, description, location, category (e.g., plumbing, electrical), and budget.
- **Job Listings**: Workers browse available jobs via a list or map view, with filters for location, category, or pay.
- **Matching System**: An algorithm suggests optimal worker-job matches based on skills, proximity, availability, and ratings.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: In-app chat enables direct communication between workers and clients.
- **Job Management**: Both parties track job statuses (e.g., "Applied," "In Progress," "Completed").
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Clients rate and review workers post-job, with feedback visible on worker profiles.
- **Geolocation**: Location-based features display job proximity and enable map-based browsing.

  - RESTful API (e.g., Node.js with Express or Django) for data operations.
  - Database: PostgreSQL (SQL) for structured data or MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexibility.
  - Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth 2.0.
  - Real-time: WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or Firebase for messaging.

### 2. Application Architecture
- **Screens**:  
  1. **Welcome Screen**: Displays app logo and "Get Started" button.
  2. **Role Selection Screen**: Buttons for "Worker" or "Client" selection.
  3. **Sign Up/Login Screens**: Forms for authentication.
  4. **Profile Setup Screen (Worker)**: Inputs for skills, rates, service areas, and photo uploads.
  5. **Job Posting Screen (Client)**: Form for job details (title, description, etc.).
  6. **Job Listings Screen (Worker)**: Map and list view of available jobs.
  7. **Job Details Screen**: Detailed job info with apply/accept options.
  8. **Worker Profile Screen (Client)**: Worker details, ratings, and reviews.
  9. **Messaging Screen**: Chat interface for communication.
  10. **Job Management Screen**: Tracks job statuses for both roles.
  11. **Review Submission Screen**: Post-job rating and comment form.

- **Navigation**:  
  - **Stack Navigator**: For linear flows (e.g., Welcome → Role Selection → Sign Up).
  - **Tab Navigator**: For job management (e.g., tabs for "Open," "In Progress," "Completed").

- **State Management**:  
  - **Local**: `useState` and `useEffect` for screen-specific data (e.g., form inputs).
  - **Global**: Context API or Redux (v8.x) for app-wide state (e.g., user role, job list).
  - **Real-Time**: WebSockets or Firebase for live updates (e.g., messages, job status).

- **Data Models**:  
  - **User**: `id, name, email, password (hashed), role (worker/client), profile_picture`.
  - **WorkerProfile**: `user_id, skills (array), rate (numeric), service_areas (array), ratings (avg), reviews (array)`.
  - **Job**: `id, title, description, category, location (lat, long), budget, status, client_id, worker_id`.
  - **Message**: `id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp`.
  - **Review**: `id, job_id, worker_id, client_id, rating (1-5), comment, timestamp`.

### 3. Key Technical Implementations
- **Geolocation and Maps**:  
  - Use `expo-location` to fetch user location with permission handling.
  - Integrate `react-native-maps` for job location visualization.
  - Calculate distances using the Haversine formula:  
    ```javascript
    const haversineDistance = (lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) => {
      const R = 6371; // Earth radius in km
      const dLat = (lat2 - lat1) * Math.PI / 180;
      const dLon = (lon2 - lon1) * Math.PI / 180;
      const a = Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
                Math.cos(lat1 * Math.PI / 180) * Math.cos(lat2 * Math.PI / 180) *
                Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2);
      const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
      return R * c; // Distance in km
    };
    ```
- **Image Handling**:  
  - Use `expo-image-picker` for photo uploads:  
    ```javascript
    import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';
    const pickImage = async () => {
      let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
        mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
        allowsEditing: true,
        aspect: [1, 1],
        quality: 0.5,
      });
      if (!result.canceled) return result.assets[0].uri;
    };
    ```
  - Compress images before upload to reduce bandwidth usage.

- **Real-Time Messaging**:  
  - Option 1: Use `react-native-gifted-chat` with WebSockets:  
    ```javascript
    import GiftedChat from 'react-native-gifted-chat';
    const MessagingScreen = () => {
      const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
      useEffect(() => {
        socket.on('message', (msg) => {
          setMessages((prev) => GiftedChat.append(prev, msg));
        });
      }, []);
      return <GiftedChat messages={messages} onSend={(msg) => socket.emit('message', msg)} />;
    };
    ```
  - Option 2: Firebase Realtime Database for simplicity.

- **Matching Algorithm**:  
  - Backend logic to score workers:  
    ```javascript
    const matchScore = (worker, job) => {
      const skillMatch = worker.skills.some(skill => job.category.includes(skill)) ? 1 : 0;
      const distance = haversineDistance(worker.lat, worker.long, job.lat, job.long);
      const rating = worker.ratings || 0;
      return (skillMatch * 0.5) + (1 - distance/100) * 0.3 + (rating/5) * 0.2;
    };
    ```
  - Sort workers by score and return top matches.

- **Push Notifications**:  
  - Use `expo-notifications`:  
    ```javascript
    import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
    const sendNotification = async (title, body) => {
      await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
        content: { title, body },
        trigger: null, // Immediate
      });
    };
    ```

- **Performance Optimization**:  
  - Use `FlatList` for efficient list rendering:  
    ```javascript
    <FlatList
      data={jobs}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <JobCard job={item} />}
      keyExtractor={item => item.id}
      initialNumToRender={10}
      maxToRenderPerBatch={5}
    />
    ```
  - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for job listings.

- **Security**:  
  - Secure API endpoints with JWT:  
    ```javascript
    const apiCall = async (endpoint, token) => {
      return axios.get(endpoint, { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } });
    };
    ```
  - Use HTTPS and hash passwords with bcrypt.

### 4. Development Workflow

  ```bash
  npx expo init BlueCollarAI --template blank
  cd BlueCollarAI
